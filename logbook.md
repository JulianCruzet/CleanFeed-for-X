## Sessions

### Session 1 - 2025-08-07
**Goals:**
- Initial project setup
- Create project structure
- Set up build system
- Implement basic keyword filtering

**Work Completed:**
- ✅ Full Chrome extension structure with Manifest V3
- ✅ TypeScript + Webpack build system configured
- ✅ Keyword detection engine with case-sensitive "OF" detection
- ✅ Content script with MutationObserver for dynamic content
- ✅ Blur/Remove filtering modes with UI overlay
- ✅ Settings popup (compact 280px design)
- ✅ Chrome storage integration for preferences
- ✅ 24-hour user cache system
- ✅ Comment/reply filtering support
- ✅ NSFW username detection
- ✅ Telegram link filtering
- ✅ Leak-related keyword filtering
- ✅ Enhanced blur effects (25-40px blur based on strictness)
- ✅ Compact mode for small comments
- ✅ Navigation fix for unblurred posts
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (33 tests passing)

**Challenges:**
- Twitter DOM structure detection (resolved with multiple selectors)
- Case-sensitive "OF" vs lowercase "of" (fixed with proper regex)
- Comment UI too large (created compact mode)
- Popup runtime errors (created simpler storage-only version)
- Unblur navigation issues (added state management)

**Next Steps:**
- Test on live Twitter
- Add more sophisticated bio detection
- Consider ML-based detection for future
- Add whitelist management UI
- Performance optimization if needed

**Notes:**
- Extension filters: OnlyFans, OF (uppercase only), leak/leaked/leaks, Telegram links, NSFW usernames
- Two modes: Blur (with unblur button) or Remove (completely hidden)
- Blur strength varies by strictness setting
- All settings auto-save to Chrome storage
- Debug logging included for troubleshooting
